Portfolio Website:

I created this website as an assignment for my Interactive Development module where this would basically be my portfolio, and talk about me and why I should be hired.

Design Process:

I designed it as such so that it would be by chronological order, first knowing briefly about myself, then as the user scrolls down, they get to learn more and at the end, if they are interested in me as an applicant, they are able to contact me via the form.

I wanted to intrigue the recruiter, so I decided to implement a rotating word list, showcasing what I am learning as of now.
I also wanted the website to be as interractive as possible, so I decided for any image or gif that I implement, if you hover over it, it will zoom in, as well as if there are any relevant links, to be linked to the image.
I also tried to keep the website as neat and tidy as possible, sticking with solid colors, as well as a simple color palette.

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears

Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.
